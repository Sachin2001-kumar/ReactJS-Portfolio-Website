            Hello! I'm a fourth-year college student deeply immersed in the
            world of coding, specializing in C++, Python, and mastering the
            intricacies of Data Structures and Algorithms. As a Full Stack
            Developer, I'm driven by a strong problem-solving instinct and a
            commitment to crafting efficient solutions. My passion extends
            beyond the classroom as I'm constantly seeking new knowledge,
            staying abreast of emerging technologies, and embracing challenges
            that come my way.
          </p>
          <p className="hero--section-description">
            In addition to my technical expertise, I bring a collaborative
            spirit to every project. I thrive on the synergy of diverse minds
            working towards a common goal. Detail-oriented and committed to
            excellence, I ensure that each line of code contributes to a
            polished and robust final product. Let's embark on this coding
            journey together!
